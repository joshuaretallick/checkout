Introduction

The test should take no longer than 2 hours to complete.

Task

We are working with a client who wants to launch an e-commerce site to promote their brand, below are some of the products that they will be listing:

ID | Name | Price

0001 | Water Bottle | £24.95

0002 | Hoodie | £65.00

0003 | Sticker Set | £3.99

The marketing team would like to run the following promotions;

● If you spend over £75 then you get a 10% discount

● If you buy two or more water bottles then the price drops to £22.99 each

Multiple promotions can be applied to the same checkout

The checkout system needs to be able to scan the items in any order then apply the promotion rules.

These rules should be allowed to change over time.

The​ ​pseudocode​ below outlines the interface for the checkout

checkout = new checkout(promotionalRules)

checkout.scan(items) //List of item objects created from the products above

println(checkout.total()) //e.g. £68.99

Implement a checkout that meets these requirements.
